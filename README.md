# Star RagBrawl
The aim of this project is to create a game within a simulation which will a living background for it.
The simulation of stars is done with Unity's DOTS approach, which is a way for me to learn it.
Then, if possible, a brawl game featuring rag dolls will be created within the simulation using DOTS too.

# Work in progress
Currently working on shaders to get nice looking stars.
Next step is implementing the GravitationSystem.
